Comment Reflower is a Visual Studio 2008 Plugin to reflow the text in comments in source files to have even word wrapping.
It does more than simply just wrapping all text in comment blocks. It attempts to recognise and wrap appropriately:<BR>
- bullet points<BR>
- lines that should always break flow of text<BR>
- XML preformat blocks<BR>
- HTML break commands<BR>
<BR>
For information on running Comment Reflower on a file see <A href="Commands.htm">Commands</A>.<BR>

For information on configuring Comment Reflower to handle your particular settings for comment blocks, bullet points and
break flow lines, see the <A href="Settings.htm">Settings section</A>.<BR>
